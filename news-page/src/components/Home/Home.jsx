        <h2>China Covid: Protests continue in major cities across the country</h2>
        <h3>Protests against strict Covid measures in China have spilled into a second night and spread to the biggest cities.</h3>
        <h4>Demonstrators gathered in the capital Beijing and the financial hub Shanghai. <br/>

Many held up blank pieces of paper to express their discontent and acknowledge the censorship. Some have, however, gone as far as calling for President Xi Jinping to step down.<br/>

Millions have been affected by nearly three years of mass testing, quarantines and snap lockdowns.<br/>

It is very unusual for people to publicly vent their anger at Communist Party leaders in China, where any direct government criticism can result in harsh penalties.<br/>

The police have largely allowed the rallies to continue, but in Shanghai officers arrested several people and cordoned off streets on Sunday.<br/>

Hundreds of people gathered on the banks of a river in the capital Beijing for several hours on Sunday, singing the national anthem and listening to speeches.<br/>

Earlier in Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University, dozens held a peaceful protest and sung the national anthem, according to pictures and video posted on social media.<br/>

Shocking protests are huge challenge for China's leaders
Protests also took place during the day in the south-western city of Chengdu and central cities of Xi'an and also Wuhan - where the Covid outbreak originated nearly three years ago.<br/>

Videos posted on social media appear to show hundreds of Wuhan residents taking to the streets, with some protesters pictured knocking down barricades and smashing metal gates.<br/>

The latest unrest follows a protest in the north-western city of Urumqi, where lockdown rules were blamed for hampering rescue efforts after a tower block fire in which 10 people died. China's authorities have denied those claims.<br/>
